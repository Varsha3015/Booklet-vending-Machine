# Detailed description of Booklet vending modelling:
The design of the machine is too simple, but the setup of the components is very significant.In
this project ,a technique based on coin system and accordingly a particular function is 
performed. The design of the project begins with the four slots ,first slot is coin dropping slot 
through which we drop coin if it is 10 Rs coin then it will move to collection box through the 
slope otherwise coin is sent to dismissal zone which is second slot . and the third slot is 
dispenser where booklets are dispensed and the fourth slot booklet holder where booklets are 
placed.Now coming to the connection part the procedure begins with the connection of two 
solenoid push &pulls then thereafter it is placed in vending machine box. After that coin is 
dropped through the slot if it is 10 Rs coin then it will move to collection box through the slope 
where we place aluminium foil for detection of coin, if the response is detected then solenoid 
push &pulls push the booklet ,then it will dispense booklet and coin is moved to collection box 
through slope otherwise coin is sent to dismissal zone.
